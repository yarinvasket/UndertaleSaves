## Routes
Use the different branches to jump to another route.
For example, to jump to pacifist route `git checkout pacifist`
You can see a list of all the routes by running `git branch`

### Specific point in a route
To see all save points in the current route, use `git log`
then to jump to the save point, use `git checkout [commit id]`
